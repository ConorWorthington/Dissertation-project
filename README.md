This project contains 4 seperate folders 
The main folder Emotion Transformer Suite contains both the python source and a compiled python distributable for OS X (Note this is not the semi empty folder with the dash OS X in front this is how windows/ github is representing the extracted zip for some reason)
The other 3 folders contain training data and applications which can be utilised to train models which the system relies upon
The project identifies input faces, classifies them and subsequently uses novel computer vision techniques to perform emotional transformations

The main bulk of the code is accessible at:
