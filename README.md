This project contains 4 seperate folders 
The main folder Emotion Transformer Suite contains both the python source and a compiled python distributable for OS X (Note this is not the semi empty folder with the dash OS X in front this is how windows/ github is representing the extracted zip for some reason)
The other 3 folders contain training data and applications which can be utilised to train models which the system relies upon
Please enjoy
